# ConLoRA
ConLoRA is a platform for distributed fine-tuning of large models in a fully decentralized federated learning scenario. Relying on this platform, you can perform fine-tuning of large models in a completely decentralized network. In particular, to address the inherent error issues in decentralized federated learning, this platform allows you to observe the consensus error amplification effect caused by LoRA and provides the option to mitigate this error by freezing the A matrix during training.
